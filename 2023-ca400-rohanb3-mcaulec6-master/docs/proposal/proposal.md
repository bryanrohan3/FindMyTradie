### Introduction

> Describe the general area covered by the project.

Have you ever needed a tradesperson but didn't know how to find one? Or maybe you've needed a specific type of tradesperson and didn't know where to start looking. 
FindMyTradie will be an easy-to-use application that allows users to search for tradespeople in their local area. Simply enter your postcode and the type of tradesperson you're looking for, and the application will do the rest! You can also filter your search results by distance, so you can find tradespeople who are close to you. Local Tradespeople is the perfect solution for finding tradespeople in your local area.


### Outline

> Outline the proposed project.

- Users can create an account and login.
-	Users can search for tradespeople in their local area. 
- Tradespeople can make accounts to upload their services. 
- Tradespeople can upload their services. 
- Users can view tradespeople's services.
- Users can contact tradespeople through the website or app.


### Background

> Where did the ideas come from?

The proposed project idea came from where we feel there is a lack of applications to provide customers with direct contact to tradespeople, many tradespeople are found through word of mouth which is unreliable. Our application would cut out the middleman and allow customers to select the tradesperson they feel is best suited to their needs.


### Achievements

> What functions will the project provide? Who will the users be?

- Chat Application.
- Ability to search for trades service in desired areas.
- See the tradesperson profile before selecting them.
- Leave reviews on tradespeoples profiles and a rating.
- Users will be people requiring skilled tradespeople(painters, plumbers, carpenters, bricklayers etc..)


### Justification

> Why/when/where/how will it be useful?

It will allow customers to be independent and well informed about tradespeople in their locality before deciding on requesting a service, it will make contacting a tradesperson much easier for everyone.


### Programming language(s)

> List the proposed language(s) to be used.

Python
JavaScript

### Programming tools / Tech stack

> Describe the compiler, database, web server, etc., and any other software tools you plan to use.

MongoDB Atlas - we plan to use MongoDB Atlas as this will store the data input which we receive from the usersâ€™ of the application (e.g. User details, Reviews, Rating etc.) 
React Native - we will use React Native for the front end of the app as we feel it will provide a slick and responsive user experience & user interface for both mobile applications and web applications.
We will use Expo which is a bundle of tools for React Native.
Auth0 - This will be used for the login page where users can sign in through their google accounts fast and easily.
Google Maps API - Location needed for both user and tradesperson.
Stripe - For Payments between customers and tradesperson
FastAPI - backend framework .

### Hardware

> Describe any non-standard hardware components which will be required.

We will not be using any non-standard hardware components for this project.


### Learning Challenges

> List the main new things (technologies, languages, tools, etc) that you will have to learn.

React Native
MongoDB
We have never built a mobile application so that will be a good learning experience
Possibly adding a payment solution (Crypto or Visa/Mastercard).
Google Maps API
Stripe Payments

### Breakdown of work

> Clearly identify who will undertake which parts of the project.
>
> It must be clear from the explanation of this breakdown of work both that each student is responsible for
> separate, clearly-defined tasks, and that those responsibilities substantially cover all of the work required
> for the project.
